# Teacher Information

This TypeScript project defines a `Teacher` interface and creates an instance of it.

## Code Overview

The code consists of two main parts:

1. **Teacher Interface**: This defines the structure of a `Teacher` object, which includes `firstName`, `lastName`, `fullTimeEmployee`, `yearsOfExperience`, `location`, and an index signature `[key: string]: any;` to allow additional attributes with any value.

2. **Teacher Instance**: An instance of the `Teacher` interface named `esianyo` is created. This object includes `firstName`, `lastName`, `fullTimeEmployee`, `location`, and `contract`.

The `console.log(esianyo);` statement will print the `esianyo` object to the console.

## Usage

To use this code, you need to have a TypeScript compiler installed. You can compile the TypeScript file into JavaScript using the `tsc` command. The resulting JavaScript file can be run in a JavaScript environment (like Node.js or a web browser) to display the `esianyo` object.
